can you help me review my code. 

point out any design problems. issues with general code organization. 
issues with poor separation of concerns, inconsistent naming or just bad naming in general
code that should live in a different place. 
point out unused complexity

improved folder structure, useful abstractions, repeated code. 

point out new files that i should make and any existing files i should change, even if you don't have a complete plan in mind, just point out flaws in the codebase
